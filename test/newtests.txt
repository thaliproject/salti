 if no identity, verify that it's loopback address calling.
 
  * If req.connection.pskIdentity is null/undefined then we MUST:
 * - check req.ip to make sure that the IP address is set to
 * "127.0.0.1"
 * - make a case sensitive string compare and make sure that
 * the value of the authorization header after the "CLEAR" keyword matches
 * the value set in this object.
 * If both checks pass then we MUST call next(). Otherwise we MUST immediately
 * return a 401 Unauthorized and close the connection as defined below. For now
 * we won't worry about also returning a www-authenticate header.
